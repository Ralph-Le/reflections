I would use an remote repositry if different people and/or different places would be working on the code.
Maybe the change is detrimental or needs a new branch
Branch: Mulitlinear history of a repository 
Clone: Copy of repository
Fork: Github clone of repository
If you have the last knwon state of the remote stored locally, you can simply update that branch by FETCH when there were differences applied to to the remote and have a new branch and not your changes ovewrwritten like with PULL
